# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

This README provides an overview and quick links to all OctoAcme project management process documents. These processes standardize how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve projects.

### OctoAcme Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to standardize how cross-functional teams deliver product features, services, and integrations, ensuring clear ownership, repeatable execution, and continuous improvement.

#### Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle is structured into distinct phases:

- **Initiation**: Create a Project One-pager outlining problem statement, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and key milestones
- **Planning**: Break work into actionable increments, prioritize backlog items with defined acceptance criteria, and manage risks and dependencies through a centralized Risk Register
- **Execution**: Implement features with focus on code quality, estimation, and design reviews
- **Release**: Follow standardized checklists covering readiness, deployment, and rollback procedures
- **Retrospective**: Conduct structured retrospectives after each milestone to capture actionable lessons and enhance team performance

#### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, maintains schedules, manages risks, and ensures transparent communication
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines problem statements, prioritizes the backlog, and measures outcomes
- **Developers**: Implement features, maintain high code quality, and participate in estimation and design reviews
- **QA/Testing**: Ensure deliverables meet documented acceptance criteria through automated and manual testing

#### Communication Cadence

- Daily standups
- Weekly syncs
- Regular demos
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Status and risk communication through templates and dashboards
- Clear escalation paths from team-level triage to sponsor-level escalation

#### Quality Assurance

- Unit and integration tests required for new logic
- Automated tests and security scans in CI pipelines
- Manual QA as needed
- Incident response protocols in place

#### Continuous Improvement

Structured retrospectives after each milestone drive continuous improvement by capturing actionable lessons to refine practices and enhance team performance over time.
